oversimplified simulation of magnetic field lines of a magnet (in the future i'll work a bit more on that project)

**controls**:
- moving magnet: [W,A,S,D]
- increasing magnet strength: [1]
- decreasing magnet strength: [2]

**changelog**:

05.03.23:
- added the simpliest gravitation simulation (activate with [Q], disabled by default)

08.03.23:
- removed the 2nd magnet, now working on only 1 magnet

12.03.23:
- reworked the magnetic field
