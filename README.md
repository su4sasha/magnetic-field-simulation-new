oversimplified simulation of magnetic field lines of a magnet (in the future I'll work a bit more on that project)

**controls**:
- moving magnet: [W,A,S,D]
- increasing magnet strength: [1]
- decreasing magnet strength: [2]
- activating/deactivating the gravitation simulation: [Q]
- summoning a positive charged particle: [+ (EQUALS key)]
- summoning a negative charged particle: [-]

**changelog**:

05.03.23:
- added the simplest gravitation simulation (activate with [Q], disabled by default)

08.03.23#1:
- removed the 2nd magnet, now working on only 1 magnet

12.03.23#2:
- reworked the magnetic field

12.03.23#3:
- trying to make the magnet-particle system work

14.03.23:
- reworked particle's movement in the magnetic field and kinda made it work

15.03.23:
- finally realised the magnet's impact on particle
